# MindSync – Real-Time Collaborative Knowledge Map

🧠 Concept

MindSync is not a regular “note-taking” or “to-do” app. Instead, it’s a visual knowledge brain where ideas are represented as nodes and connections as edges.
Unlike traditional tools (Google Docs, Notion), this one gives you a living, glowing map of your knowledge – and multiple people can edit it together in real-time.

🎯 Core Features
1. Landing Page

Clean hero section introducing MindSync.

Buttons: Get Started, Sign In, Sign Up.

Visual preview of a glowing knowledge map in the background.

2. User Authentication

Signup/Login/Logout with JWT tokens.

Profile page where users manage their data.

Secure password handling.

3. Dashboard

Displays all maps a user has created.

Buttons:

Create New Map

Open Map

Delete Map

Public vs private maps toggle.

4. Mind Map Editor

Built using React + D3.js (or React Flow) for interactive graph visualization.

Core actions:

Add Node → create a new draggable bubble.

Link Node → connect two bubbles with a glowing line.

Delete Node → remove nodes and their edges.

Save Graph → persist to database.

Export Graph → download as PNG or PDF.

Dark Mode → neon glowing cyberpunk theme.

Smooth animations, zooming, panning, and responsive UI.

5. Collaboration

Real-time editing with WebSockets or Supabase Realtime.

Show colored cursors for each collaborator.

Changes sync instantly for all users (like Google Docs but with mind maps).

6. AI Integration

When adding a node, the system suggests related ideas.

Example: If you add Machine Learning, AI may suggest Neural Networks or Data Science.

Suggested nodes appear as ghost bubbles with an Accept button.

7. Database

Use Supabase (preferred) or Firebase.

Store:

User profiles.

Graph data (nodes + edges).

Collaboration rooms.

Support for real-time updates.

8. Other Features

Gamification – badges for milestones (10 nodes created, 5 maps shared, etc.).

Search & Filter – quickly find nodes inside large maps.

Offline-first support (PWA) – users can open and edit maps even offline.

Exportable Graphs – share maps in PDF/PNG.

Mobile Friendly – works smoothly on both phone and desktop.
